# Microsoft SQL Server Security Overview
This repository contains a script that gives you an overview of permissions on your database.

## Requirements
SQL Server 2k8 and above, SQL Server Management Studio and DB-Owner-access to the database you want to Query.

## How to Use
 - Copy and run the script into `SQL Server Management Studio`.
 - Investigate the result.
 - (Alternative you can create a view which you can query further and do more advanced querying on).

## Whatâ€™s Next?
This small script gives a good perspective of the access given on your databases. The script was originally shared on StackOverFlow.
